# Equity-Analysis_AppLovin
This project leverages the Wolfram Language to conduct a computational equity analysis of AppLovin (APP), moving beyond traditional spreadsheet modeling to focus on data visualization and narrative-driven insights.
While grounded in fundamental analysis, the core objective of this project was to automate data retrieval and visualize the "story" behind the numbers.
Key Technical Highlights:
Programmatic Data Pipeline: Integrated the SEC EDGAR API to automatically pull real-time financial statements for AppLovin and its key competitors, ensuring data accuracy and scalability.
Alternative Data & NLP: Applied Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze earnings call transcripts and conducted web traffic/digital footprint analysis to gauge brand momentum beyond reported financials.
Visual Storytelling: Created extensive custom visualizations to illustrate market positioning, revenue composition, and competitive benchmarking, transforming complex datasets into an intuitive investment narrative.
